# Baltimore area 2018 population by demographic characteristics analysis

## Baltimore Sun analysis

By [Christine Zhang](mailto:czhang@baltsun.com)

The Baltimore Sun conducted an analysis of county-level population estimates by age, sex and race/ethnicity analysis for a story published June 19, 2019 titled ["Baltimore's white population swells with millennials, resembling D.C., Brooklyn"](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-census-estimate-population-race-20190619-story.html).

The Sun's findings and analysis are available in the "analysis" notebook in this repository: [`02_analysis.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/baltimore-sun-data/population-estimates-race-2018/blob/master/02_analysis.ipynb). The pre-processing code is in the "processing" notebook in this repository: [`01_processing.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/baltimore-sun-data/population-estimates-race-2018/blob/master/01_processing.ipynb).

The raw datasets are saved in the `input` folder.  The cleaned files are saved in the `output` folder. Note that these files are compressed as `input/inputdata.zip` and `output/outputdata.zip` and will need to be unzipped prior to analysis.
